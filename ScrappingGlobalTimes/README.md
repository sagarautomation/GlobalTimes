Description:
This project is very simple and small project.
The script will open Chinese Govt run Global Times website and scrape the articles from the links of Homepage.
Let us suppose if there are 10 links in the homepage then what the script will do is navigate all the links one by one
copy the content and paste it in a file.The file creation is also dynamic for instance if there are 10 unique links 
means 10 files will be created and post that the content or article will be copied.
